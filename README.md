Overview
The goal of this project is to build a Holiday Management Application that fetches holiday data using the Calendarific API. It enables users to search, filter, and display holidays based on their chosen country and year.

The project consists of:
  1. A Django backend that fetches and serves holiday data via REST APIs.
  2. A React frontend that interacts with the Django backend and displays the data in a responsive user interface.
